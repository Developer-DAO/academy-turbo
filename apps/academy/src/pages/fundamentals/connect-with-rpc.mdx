## Connecting the Dots from Web1 to Web3

In the era of **Web1**, information retrieval was primarily one-directional. Users consumed static
content through technologies like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and the data fetching process
was relatively straightforward.

**Web2** introduced a new era of interactivity, user-generated content, and the social web.
Technologies like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) still play a crucial role in enabling
dynamic, asynchronous interactions between the user's browser and the server.

### The Rise of Web3

The protocols introduced in the Web1 and Web2 eras still form the backbone of communication, but data
inevitably found its way into silos managed by gatekeepers. Social media, search and online retail giants
found themselves with massive amounts of user data and customers willing to pay for that data. As that
trade-offs became better understood by Internet users, alternatives were sought for healthier digital
ecosystems.

Now, in what has been dubbed **Web3**, we explore what could be the next era of the Internet. Web3
means different things to different people, but it generally refers to more decentralised, user-centric
systems, leveraging modern cryptography and blockchain technology. In this world, users have more
control over their data, their digital identity, and their ability to interact in these peer-to-peer
permissionless systems.

In the remainder of this lesson, we're going to help you get familiar with an important concept within
Web3 development ‚Äî the Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Note that RPC is not a new concept invented alongside
blockchains - original credit goes to Bruce Jay Nelson in 1984 - but the pattern is leveraged heavily in
this domain.

## RPC

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** could be classified as a type of API
(application programming interface) that allows for developers to run code that
can be executed on servers remotely. In plain English, an RPC call is how an app
communicates with a blockchain or accesses other information from remote
servers.

### JSON-RPC

More specifically, **JSON-RPC** has been adopted as the standard protocol for
communication with Ethereum nodes. JSON-RPC is a stateless, light-weight RPC protocol.
Its design is simple, and it uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as the data
format for the request and response. JSON-RPC is transport agnostic, meaning that
requests and responses can be sent over any transport protocol, such as HTTP or
WebSockets.

### Ethereum JSON-RPC

Finally, we get down to the blockchain level. The Ethereum JSON-RPC specification
defines a set of methods that can be called to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
These methods include things like getting the balance of an account, sending transactions,
reading contract data, and more. The Ethereum JSON-RPC specification is a standard
that all Ethereum clients (e.g., Geth, Nethermind) adhere to, and sometimes extend to
include additional custom functionality.

The JSON payload for a balance lookup might look something like this:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getBalance",
  "params": ["0x7dcd17...", "latest"],
  "id": 1
}
```

The response might look something like this:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x3f"
}
```

Now, this is pretty clunky to do by hand. Fortunately, there are libraries and
tools that can help you make these calls in a more human-friendly way. Even better
for casual users, wallets will construct and make these calls for you, and display
the results in a more user-friendly way.

In the next section, we'll get our hands dirty by using Zerion wallet to connect to
an Ethereum testnet and connect to a custom RPC endpoint provider, such as POKT Network.

## Connecting to a Testnet with Zerion

When opening up the Zerion browser extension, we can connect to the various
testnets as seen below, by clicking on the extension's icon, the Settings gear ‚öôÔ∏è
wheel, choosing Networks, and selecting the desired test network:

![Testnets on Zerion](/assets/lessons/connect-with-rpc/test-networks-zerion.png)

If you are trying to view a given network‚Äôs RPC connection information, it can be
accessed by clicking on the arrow to the right of the network name. In my case,
I'm connected to the Sepolia testnet. You can see its Network Name, RPC URL,
Chain ID, Currency Symbol, Decimals and Block Explorer URL shown below:

### Add a Network

A lot of networks are already pre-loaded in the wallet, otherwise any new network's
details should be provided to you, e.g., in a tutorial that you're working from. A new
network can be added in Zerion by clicking on the **Add Network** button. Add the six
data inputs for your chosen network, similar to the Sepolia example in the image above.

An alternative way of adding network choices is through
[Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/)'s website. It's quite self-explanatory,
but be sure to check ‚òëÔ∏è the **Include Testnets** option. Chainlist is a rich source
of RPC statistics for EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains.

## Connecting a dApp through an RPC Endpoint Provider

In blockchain development, it is necessary to connect your dApp to the
blockchain to deploy smart contracts and interact with the deployed contract.
This can be done by either running your own blockchain node (e.g., Geth, Nethermind)
or accessing the blockchain through an RPC endpoint service. Connecting through
one of these node providers is much easier than running your own node.

By using a node provider, it is quick and easy, and usually free to open an
account that will get you access to RPC endpoints of many different testnets
including Sepolia Ethereum, Polygon Mumbai, Optimistic Goerli, and Scroll Sepolia.

### Which RPC should I use?

There are many node providers nowadays, and you might recognise some names
such as Ankr, Alchemy, and Infura among others. We're going to look at POKT Network,
a decentralised RPC base layer that operates as an ecosystem of providers,
as opposed to a monolithic RPC company. Its network's diverse ecosystem of
node operators ensures uptime, and therefore resilience. We recommend choosing
from one of the _Gateways_ built on top of POKT Network's RPC baselayer:

- [Grove](https://www.grove.city/)
- [Nodies](https://www.nodies.app/)

With both, you can sign up with email, or Github, and proceed to "create an
application/project" to get your app's ID keys. With your key, you've got access
to the blockchain - you can read data, send transactions, and deploy contracts.

### Are you a Developer DAO member?

If you're a Developer DAO member, you are hopefully aware of some of the
"Developer DAO Perks" for Web3 we have. Let's take advantage of one of
those, and get you hooked up with Grove:

- click [here](https://devdao.to/grove-perk) to access the D_D Grove Perk
- connect and sign with your wallet that contains the D4R NFT or 400+ $CODE
- register with your email
- check your email for your perk and further instructions
- choose the development wallet to use with the perk

Are you not yet a member of Developer DAO? There is no time like the present. üòÅ

### Important Security Notes

It is super important to always double-check the website URL you are clicking
on and any pop-up messages in Zerion, when connecting your wallet. If you are on
the wrong website and you allow access to your wallet, you may actually be allowing
hackers access to it. You don't want that. Always double-check! At Developer DAO
Academy, we strongly advise using a separate browser profile and wallet for
development. Be safe!

### Outro

We hope you now have enough insights on connecting to testnets and RPC endpoint
providers, and that you're equipped to navigate the decentralised web in your
development journey. Whether you're a seasoned Developer DAO member or just starting
out, stay curious, stay secure, and keep building this dynamic digital wonderworld.
