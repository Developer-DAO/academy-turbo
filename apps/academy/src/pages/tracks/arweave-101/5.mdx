## About this lesson

Greetings! I welcome you to the second project lesson of the Arweave 101 track. In the previous
lesson, you learned how to build and deploy a static website to Arweave. The website only allowed
users to view the content but not edit it. In this lesson, you will go to the next step: build a
blog to create and update articles inside the browser.

You will create a single-page application (SPA) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a popular web
application bundler. You will use React as a UI framework and handle Arweave uploads with the Turbo
SDK in the browser.

## Prerequisites

You must **complete [lessons 2](/tracks/arweave-101/2), [lessons 3](/tracks/arweave-101/3), and
[lessons 4](/tracks/arweave-101/4)**. You need the **wallet address you charged with Turbo
Credits** in lesson 3 and **the ArNS name you registered** in lesson 4.

You need a basic understanding of web technologies like HTTPS, HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, and React.

A **basic understanding of blockchains** is helpful, too. At least you should understand what
wallets and transactions are.

A **browser, Node.js, and an ArConnect wallet** to try the examples.

Since using **web crypto functions requires HTTPS**, you might want to use a cloud IDE like [GitHub
Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or a service like [lcl.host](https://lcl.host/).

## Why a Single-Page Application?

While server-side rendering is all the hype, the fastest way to get a DApp up and running on Arweave
is to follow the SPA approach. Arweave gateways can’t execute your code, so static generation and
client-side rendering are the way to go. In the previous lesson, you rendered HTML at build-time;
now, you’ll render it dynamically in the browser.

An SPA can be slower than a static website but more flexible. It enables you to include data stored
on Arweave into the rendering that wasn’t available at build time, so you don’t have to build and
deploy a new release every time something changes.

## Creating the DApp

You will build a blog with React and use Vite as the JavaScript bundler. In contrast to the prior
version of the blog, this one will allow you to create and update articles in the browser.

Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of the new blog. React and React Router form the base for the
pages, which will use a storage utility that interacts with Arweave through the ArweaveKit and Turbo
SDK. Vite will build the app, and the Turbo SDK will deploy it on Arweave. This means there are two
locations where you write data to Arweave:

1. In a Node.js deployment script.
2. In the DApp in the browser.

### Creating the Project and Installing the Dependencies

First, you create a new Vite project based on the React template:

```bash
npm create vite@latest permablog-v2 -- --template react
```

Next, you install the dependencies.

- React Router for navigation.
- The Turbo SDK for uploading new articles to Arweave.
- The AR.IO SDK is used to change your ArNS with a script.
- Arweave Wallet Kit gives you a nice button to log in to create and update articles.
- Arweave Kit will query articles from Arweave gateways via GraphQL.

```bash
cd permablog-v2
npm i react-router-dom @ardrive/turbo-sdk @ar.io/sdk arweave-wallet-kit arweavekit
```

After you install the dependencies, you have everything ready to build and deploy your new blog.

### Creating a Storage Utility

The first task is implementing a storage utility. It will handle all interactions with Arweave and
give you a simple interface for creating, reading, and updating articles in the rest of your code.

You will implement the read and write functionality in separate files. This way, the pages that only
need to read from the storage don’t have to fetch all the writing functions and dependencies.

#### Creating the Writing Functionality

The first part of the storage is the writing functionality, which allows you to upload new and
updated articles to Arweave.

Start by creating a new file at `src/utilities/storage.write.js`, then add the following snippets to
complete the file.

#### Including the Modules and Creating Constants

You start with the dependencies—the Turbo SDK for uploading articles.

```javascript
import * as TurboSdk from "@ardrive/turbo-sdk/web";
```

Next, you add the constants, which define some configurations: the name of your blog. You need it
later to query the articles you created for this blog.

```javascript
export const APPLICATION_NAME = "Permablog V2";
```

##### Implementing the Functions

The `uploadArticle` function converts an article object into a format suitable for the Turbo SDK.
Then, it creates an instance of the SDK, connects with the ArConnect wallet of the current browser,
and uploads the converted article as a file.

The `uploadFile` function accepts tags that enable you to customize the transaction used to upload
your article. You can use these tags in GraphQL queries to find your uploads on Arweave. It returns
the TXID for the new version of the article.

Most of the tags are just general information that makes it easier for others to categorize your
data, but a few are important, and you will use them later:

- The `Content-Type` tag ensures gateways will deliver your articles with the correct mime type to
  the browser.
- The `Application` tag allows you to filter for articles from that blog if you have multiple ones.
- The `Article-Id` tag ensures different versions of the same article have a correlating ID, so you
  can filter out older versions when listing all articles.
- The `Created-At` tag is a nice example of how you can include some parts of your content into tags
  to make it available via GraphQL. It does not need to be a query, but it’s helpful to display the
  creation dates of articles when listing them.
- `Topic` tags are generated from an article's topic list. Think of them as Arweave's hashtags.

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Note: Gateways come with GraphQL endpoints, but they can’t look into the body of a transaction;
  they can only access general transaction data and tags. Making tags the only way to customize your
  uploads for queries.
</Callout>

```javascript
const uploadArticle = async (article) => {
  const articleBlob = new Blob([JSON.stringify(article)]);
  const turbo = await TurboSdk.TurboFactory.authenticated({
    signer: new TurboSdk.ArconnectSigner(window.arweaveWallet),
  });
  const result = await turbo.uploadFile({
    fileStreamFactory: () => articleBlob.stream(),
    fileSizeFactory: () => articleBlob.size,
    dataItemOpts: {
      tags: [
        { name: "Content-Type", value: "application/json" },
        { name: "Application", value: APPLICATION_NAME },
        { name: "Article-Id", value: article.id },
        { name: "Type", value: "blog-post" },
        { name: "Title", value: article.title },
        { name: "Created-At", value: article.createdAt.toISOString() },
        ...article.topics.map((topic) => ({ name: "Topic", value: topic })),
      ],
    },
  });
  return result.id;
};
```

The `updateArticle` function comes next. It’s relatively straightforward, as the `uploadArticle`
function above does most of the work. It uploads a new article version to Arweave. The TXID will
change, but the article's ID will stay the same.

```javascript
export const updateArticle = async (article) => ({
  ...article,
  txId: await uploadArticle(article),
});
```

The `createArticle` function uses the `updateArticle` function. However, it also adds an ID to the
article, so it doesn’t correlate with any other article. This ID will stay the same on every update.

```javascript
export const createArticle = async (article) =>
  await updateArticle({
    ...article,
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  });
```

Now that you can upload your articles, let’s ensure you can also download them.

#### Creating the Reading Functionality

The reading part of the storage will include a GraphQL query to list all articles and the gateway's
data endpoint to retrieve the content of each article.

Start by creating a new file at `src/utilities/storage.read.js`, then add the following snippets to
complete the file.

##### Including the Modules and Creating Constants

You start with the dependencies—the Turbo SDK for uploads and the Arweave Kit for GraphQL queries.

```javascript
import * as ArweaveKit from "arweavekit/graphql";
```

Next, you add the constants, which define some configurations: the name of your blog and your
Arweave wallet address. You need them later to query for articles you created for this blog.

```javascript
export const APPLICATION_NAME = "Permablog V2";
export const BLOG_OWNER_ADDRESS = "xyz...123";
```

##### Implementing the Functions

You start with the GraphQL query. It will get all transactions signed by your wallet address and
have an `Application` tag with your blog’s name. It returns the newest 100 matching transactions and
sorts them from new to old. This way, the newest article versions will be on top. It will return the
ID of each TX, which you need to fetch the article content and the tags, as you will display article
creation dates when listing them.

```javascript
const LOAD_ARTICLES_QUERY = `  query($owner: String!, $application: String!) {
    transactions(
      sort: HEIGHT_DESC
      first: 100
      owners: [$owner]
      tags: [{ name: "Application", values: [$application] }]
    ) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          tags { name value }
        }
      }
    }
  }`;
```

The `getArticles` function uses the GraphQL query to fetch all article versions and filters only the
newest version of each article. The older ones are always available, as they’re permanently stored
on Arweave, but your users will only see the latest versions.

The GraphQL response won’t include the article content, as it’s stored inside the transaction body,
which isn’t accessible in a GraphQL query because it can have an arbitrary size and data format. You
can only query the transaction data, but properties like title and creation date are enough to
create a list of articles.

```javascript
export const getArticles = async () => {
  const result = await ArweaveKit.queryGQL(LOAD_ARTICLES_QUERY, {
    filters: {
      owner: BLOG_OWNER_ADDRESS,
      application: APPLICATION_NAME,
    },
    gateway: "arweave.developerdao.com",
  });

  if (!result.data || !result.data.transactions.edges) return [];

  const txs = result.data.transactions.edges.map((e) => e.node).reverse();
  const latestArticleVersions = {};

  for (const tx of txs) {
    const articleId = tx.tags.find((tag) => tag.name === "Article-Id")?.value;

    if (!articleId || latestArticleVersions[articleId]) continue;

    const title = tx.tags.find((tag) => tag.name === "Title")?.value || "";
    const createdAt = new Date(tx.tags.find((tag) => tag.name === "Created-At")?.value || 0);
    const topics = tx.tags.filter((tag) => tag.name === "Topic").map((tag) => tag.value);

    latestArticleVersions[articleId] = {
      id: articleId,
      txId: tx.id,
      title,
      createdAt,
      topics,
    };
  }

  return Object.values(latestArticleVersions);
};
```

The last function is `getArticle`, which loads only one article with content so that users can read
more than just the title. You stored the article objects as JSON inside transaction bodies, which
means you need to revive the date objects inside createdAt and add the TXID from the current version
of the article.

```javascript
export const getArticle = async (txId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://arweave.developerdao.com/${txId}`);
  const articleJson = await response.text();
  const partialArticle = JSON.parse(articleJson, (key, value) =>
    key === "createdAt" ? new Date(value) : value,
  );
  return { ...partialArticle, txId };
};
```

After finishing the storage utility, you can use it on your pages to interact with Arweave in the
browser. So, let’s move on to the pages!

### Creating the Pages

Now, let’s create the pages. Your blog will have three of them:

1. A home page that displays a list of articles.
2. An article page to read an article.
3. An editor page that allows you to create new articles and modify existing ones.

#### Creating the Home Page

The home page will display a list of articles and a “Connect Wallet” button that you’ll use later to
log in and access editor functionality.

It exports two functions:

1. React Router calls the `loader` function before rendering your page to get the data for the page.
   For this page, it will fetch all the articles.
2. The `Component` function is a React component that will render the actual HTML for the page.

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Note: The names of these functions are a convention, so React Router can find them when importing
  the files later.
</Callout>

Create a new file at `src/pages/home.jsx` to create the home page and add the following code:

```javascript
import * as ReactRouter from "react-router-dom";
import * as WalletKit from "arweave-wallet-kit";
import * as StorageRead from "../utilities/storage.read";

export const loader = async () => await StorageRead.getArticles();

export function Component() {
  const connection = WalletKit.useConnection();
  const articles = ReactRouter.useLoaderData();

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Permablog</h1>
      {connection.connected && <ReactRouter.Link to="/new/editor">Create Article</ReactRouter.Link>}
      <WalletKit.ConnectButton showBalance={false} profileModal={false} />
      <h2>Articles</h2>
      <ul>
        {articles.length === 0 && <li>No articles found.</li>}
        {articles.map((article) => (
          <li key={article.id}>
            <ReactRouter.Link to={`/${article.txId}`}>{article.title}</ReactRouter.Link>(
            {article.createdAt.toLocaleDateString()})
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

#### Creating the Article Page

The article page lets users read the article content. It will use the TXID from the URL to determine
the current article.

Create a new file at `src/pages/article.jsx` and add this code:

```javascript
import * as ReactRouter from "react-router-dom";
import * as WalletKit from "arweave-wallet-kit";
import * as StorageRead from "../utilities/storage.read";

export const loader = async ({ params }) => await StorageRead.getArticle(params["articleId"]);

export function Component() {
  const { connected } = WalletKit.useConnection();
  const article = ReactRouter.useLoaderData();
  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        <ReactRouter.Link to="/">Permablog</ReactRouter.Link>
      </h1>
      {connected && (
        <ReactRouter.Link to={`/${article.txId}/editor`}>Edit Article</ReactRouter.Link>
      )}
      <WalletKit.ConnectButton showBalance={false} />
      <hr />
      <h2>{article.title}</h2>
      <i>{article.topics.map((t) => "#" + t).join(" ")}</i>
      <p>Created at {article.createdAt.toLocaleDateString()}</p>
      <p>{article.content}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

#### Creating the Editor Page

The editor is the heart of this blog, making it an interactive DApp. Its `loader` function will
either load an existing article from Arweave or create a new one. The `Component` function will
always create a new article, based on the one supplied by the loader function, but call different
storage functions depending on the current article. You use the `createArticle` function if it’s a
new article and the `updateArticle` function if it’s an existing article. The former will override
the ID of the article.

Create a new file at `src/pages/editor.jsx` and add this code:

```javascript
import * as ReactRouter from "react-router-dom";
import * as StorageRead from "../utilities/storage.read";
import * as StorageWrite from "../utilities/storage.write";

export const loader = async ({ params }) => {
  const articleId = params["articleId"];
  if (articleId === "new") return { id: "new" };
  if (articleId) return StorageRead.getArticle(articleId);
};

export function Component() {
  const navigate = ReactRouter.useNavigate();
  const article = ReactRouter.useLoaderData();
  const isNewArticle = article.id === "new";

  const handleArticleUpdate = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const data = new FormData(event.currentTarget);

    const newArticle = {
      id: article.id,
      createdAt: new Date(),
      title: data.get("title"),
      content: data.get("content"),
      topics: data
        .get("topics")
        .split(",")
        .map((t) => t.trim()),
    };

    if (!newArticle.title || !newArticle.topics || !newArticle.content) return;

    const { txId } = isNewArticle
      ? await StorageWrite.createArticle(newArticle)
      : await StorageWrite.updateArticle(newArticle);

    navigate("/" + txId);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        <ReactRouter.Link to="/">Permablog</ReactRouter.Link>
      </h1>
      <h2>{isNewArticle ? "Create New Article" : "Update Article"}</h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleArticleUpdate}>
        <input placeholder="Title" name="title" defaultValue={article.title} />
        <br />
        <input placeholder="Topics" name="topics" defaultValue={article.topics} />
        <br />
        <textarea placeholder="Content" name="content" defaultValue={article.content} />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Save</button>
        <button
          onClick={(event) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            navigate(isNewArticle ? "/" : `/${article.txId}`);
          }}
        >
          Cancel
        </button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

After you create all the pages, you need to connect them with React Router.

#### Connecting the Pages with React Router

React Router will handle the navigation of your DApp, so you must connect your pages with it.

React Router offers regular routes that ensure the page code ends up in your application's main
bundle and lazy routes that place a page in a separate file, only loaded when required.

You will use regular routes for the home and article page and lazy routes for the editor page, as
most of your users are readers who aren’t allowed to edit, and the dependencies for writing on
Arweave are quite big.

This file is also where you initialize the `arweave-wallet-kit` to ensure the "Connect Wallet"
button asks for the correct permissions every time someone clicks it.

Create a new file at `src/main.jsx` and add this code:

```javascript
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import * as ReactRouter from "react-router-dom";
import * as WalletKit from "arweave-wallet-kit";
import * as HomeRoute from "./pages/home";
import * as ArticleRoute from "./pages/article";

const router = ReactRouter.createHashRouter([
  { path: "/", ...HomeRoute },
  { path: "/:articleId", ...ArticleRoute },
  { path: "/:articleId/editor", lazy: () => import("./pages/editor") },
])

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <WalletKit.ArweaveWalletKit
    config={{
      permissions: ["ACCESS_ADDRESS", "ACCESS_PUBLIC_KEY", "SIGNATURE"],
    }}
  >
    <ReactRouter.RouterProvider router={router} />
  </WalletKit.ArweaveWalletKit>
)
```

### Building a Release

Now that you have implemented everything, you must
build a release with Vite. To do so, call the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

If everything is okay, you should get a similar output to this:

```bash
> permablog-v2@0.0.0 build
> vite build

vite v5.3.1 building for production...
...
✓ 221 modules transformed.
dist/index.html 0.39 kB │ gzip: 0.27 kB
dist/assets/index-CxcUmfIT.js 917.01 kB │ gzip: 289.07 kB
dist/assets/editor-BQmFi87H.js 3,670.04 kB │ gzip: 1,062.05 kB

(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:

- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
  ✓ built in 13.43s
```

The editor chunk is the biggest part of your DApp, so it’s good that not all users load it. However,
you must pay for the index and the editor chunk, as they are bigger than 100 KiB. Also, the editor
chunk is the most expensive, so every change to the editor will hurt your wallet. You should think
about structuring your chunks to reuse them efficiently.

### Optimizing Releases for Upload Costs

You can define manual chunks in Vite to group modules that don’t change frequently. For example,
React, React-Router, and the Turbo SDK only change when you update the dependencies, so put them in
separate chunks.

Update the `vite.config.js` with the following code:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          turbo: ["@ardrive/turbo-sdk/web"],
          react: ["react", "react-dom", "react-router-dom"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

After this change, the output should now include five chunks. The nice part is that the editor is
now under 100 KiB, so changes to them are free!

```bash
dist/index.html 0.46 kB │ gzip: 0.30 kB
dist/assets/editor-CTfcgdGv.js 1.82 kB │ gzip: 0.91 kB
dist/assets/react-CgX-Mgf-.js 203.05 kB │ gzip: 66.31 kB
dist/assets/index-OGUd33G9.js 712.97 kB │ gzip: 223.23 kB
dist/assets/turbo-DVJqhdOv.js 3,667.86 kB │ gzip: 1,061.03 kB
```

The editor and index chunks will update with changes to the pages or your storage utility, but the
library chunks for React and the Turbo SDK will stay the same.

```bash
dist/index.html 0.46 kB │ gzip: 0.29 kB
dist/assets/editor-DuY_DuAe.js 1.82 kB │ gzip: 0.91 kB
dist/assets/react-CgX-Mgf-.js 203.05 kB │ gzip: 66.31 kB
dist/assets/index-23GsdaF6.js 712.97 kB │ gzip: 223.23 kB
dist/assets/turbo-DVJqhdOv.js 3,667.86 kB │ gzip: 1,061.03 kB
```

You don’t have to upload the react or turbo chunks again if you don't update your dependencies.

### Testing Release Locally

To run a local webserver server that serves the built files, execute this command:

```bash
npx serve ./dist
```

This should start a web server at `http://localhost:3000` where you can check all the functionality.

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Note: For development, you can also use the Vite dev server with `npm run dev`, but it’s always a
  good idea to check the code you will deploy from your `dist` directory.
</Callout>

## Deploying the DApp

Now that you have implemented and tested the blog locally, you must get it onchain. You must pay
storage fees as some files are bigger than 100 KiB.

### Setting Up a Wallet

If you completed the “Storing Data on Arweave” lesson, you have a wallet in ArConnect and exported
it as a keyfile. Copy it to your project directory and make sure it’s named `key.json`. You also
bought $5 worth of Turbo Credits in that lesson, which should be plenty to pay for these uploads.

### Creating a Deployment Script

You can upload files via the browser and Node.js. As deployments are often automated, it makes sense
to implement it as a Node.js script.

Create a new file at `scripts/deploy-app.mjs` and add the following entry to scripts in your
`package.json` file:

```json
"deploy": "npm run build && node scripts/deploy-app.mjs"
```

This script has around 100 LoC, so let’s go through it step by step and add each part to the file as
you go.

First, import the dependencies. The two out-of-the-ordinary modules are `process` and `readline`.
You use the former to exit the script and access the keyboard and the latter to confirm the upload.

```javascript
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";
import process from "node:process";
import readline from "node:readline/promises";
import mimeTypes from "mime-types";
import * as TurboSdk from "@ardrive/turbo-sdk";
```

Then, load and parse the path manifest from the previous deployment. The first time, it’s just an
empty template without any paths. You’ll use it to diff the file names, so you only upload changed
and new files.

```javascript
const previousManifest = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("manifest.json", { encoding: "utf-8" }));
```

Next, read all the files Vite created during the build process and use the path manifest from the
previous deployment to filter out files you already uploaded. If no file is left, abort.

```javascript
const getFilePaths = (directory, filePaths = []) => {
  fs.readdirSync(directory).forEach((file) => {
    const filePath = path.join(directory, file);
    if (!fs.statSync(filePath).isDirectory()) return filePaths.push(filePath);
    filePaths = getFilePaths(filePath, filePaths);
  });
  return filePaths;
};
const distFiles = getFilePaths("dist");
const changedDistFiles = distFiles.filter((filePath) => {
  const manifestFilePath = filePath.replaceAll(path.sep, "/").replace("dist/", "");
  return !previousManifest.paths[manifestFilePath];
});
if (changedDistFiles.length < 1) {
  console.log("No files changes. Aborting.");
  process.exit();
}
```

Before uploading the files, calculate the costs and ask the user if they want to upload so you don’t
accidentally drain their wallet. The balance is in the Turbo Credits token but formatted as its
smallest denominator, Winston. You get the Turbo Credits value when dividing it by one trillion
(i.e., 12 zeros).

```javascript
const turbo = TurboSdk.TurboFactory.authenticated({
  privateKey: JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("key.json", { encoding: "utf-8" })),
});
const balance = await turbo.getBalance();
console.log(`Your Balance: ${balance.winc / 1_000_000_000_000} TC`);
const costsPerFile = await turbo.getUploadCosts({
  bytes: changedDistFiles.map((filePath) => fs.statSync(filePath).size),
});
const costsInTc = costsPerFile
  .map((cost) => cost.winc / 1_000_000_000_000)
  .reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);
console.log(`Upload costs: ${costsInTc} TC`);
const key = await readline
  .createInterface({ input: process.stdin, output: process.stdout })
  .question(`Do you want to upload ${changedDistFiles.length} changed files? (y/N) `);
if (key !== "y") process.exit();
```

Now that you know all the files and clarified the costs with the user, you can start uploading
files. The resulting TXIDs get stored for later when you create the path manifest, enabling access
to all files via one TXID. If a file was already part of the previous path manifest, you can reuse
its TXID and skip the upload.

```javascript
const upload = (filePath, tags) =>
  turbo.uploadFile({
    fileStreamFactory: () => fs.createReadStream(filePath),
    fileSizeFactory: () => fs.statSync(filePath).size,
    dataItemOpts: { tags },
  });
const paths = {};
for (let filePath of distFiles) {
  const manifestFilePath = filePath.replaceAll(path.sep, "/").replace("dist/", "");
  paths[manifestFilePath] = previousManifest.paths[manifestFilePath];
  if (paths[manifestFilePath]) {
    console.log(`- ${filePath} (unchanged, skipping)`);
  } else {
    console.log(`- ${filePath} (changed, uploading)`);
    const uploadResult = await upload(filePath, [
      { name: "Content-Type", value: mimeTypes.lookup(filePath) },
    ]);
    paths[manifestFilePath] = { id: uploadResult.id };
  }
}
```

The files are all on Arweave. Now, add their TXIDs to the path manifest. By default, Vite doesn’t
add a hash to the `index.html` file it creates in the build process, but this file can change, too.
Your script can't detect the change if the file name doesn’t reflect that. In the next section, you
will solve that issue and assume that the `index.html` already has a hash in the filename. Find the
path of this file and add it as an index to your manifest; this allows users to access it with a
slash in the browser.

```javascript
const indexPath = Object.keys(paths).find((path) => !!path.match(/index-.*html$/gi));
fs.writeFileSync(
  "manifest.json",
  JSON.stringify({
    ...previousManifest,
    index: { path: indexPath },
    paths,
  }),
);
console.log("- manifest.json (changed, uploading)");
const result = await upload("manifest.json", [
  { name: "Content-Type", value: "application/x.arweave-manifest+json" },
]);
```

After you upload the path manifest, save this deployment's TXID in a file to make it available to
other scripts. Also, print the deployment's URL to open it in your browser.

```javascript
fs.writeFileSync("deployment-id", result.id);
console.log(`https://arweave.developerdao.com/${result.id}`);
process.exit();
```

This script will get your files on Arweave, but you must do two things before executing it.

#### Creating the Initial Path Manifest

First, create the initial path manifest file at manifest.json with this code:

```json
{
  "manifest": "arweave/paths",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "index": { "path": "" },
  "paths": {}
}
```

#### Adding a Hash to the Index File and Updating the Base Path

Second, as mentioned above, update the `vite.config.js` to ensure that the `index.html` also gets a
hash in its filename when building; otherwise, your deployment script will not detect its changes.

Also, define a relative `base`, or all URLs Vite generates point to the domain root, which won’t
work as Arweave gateways always start URLs with a TXID (if they don’t have an ArNS name.)

```javascript
import crypto from "node:crypto";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
const indexHtmlHash = {
  name: "html-hash",
  enforce: "post",
  generateBundle(_options, bundle) {
    const indexHtml = bundle["index.html"];
    indexHtml.fileName = `index-${crypto
      .createHash("sha256")
      .update(indexHtml.source)
      .digest("hex")
      .substring(0, 8)}.html`;
  },
};
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), indexHtmlHash],
  base: "./",
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          turbo: ["@ardrive/turbo-sdk/web"],
          react: ["react", "react-dom", "react-router-dom"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Deploying the Release

Uploading your files to Arweave is just one command away:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The output of this command should look like this:

```bash
> permablog-v2@0.0.0 deploy
> node ./scripts/deploy-app.mjs

Calculating upload costs...
Your Balance: 0.069789574662 TC
Upload costs: 0.003666849445 TC

Do you want to upload 5 changed files? (y/N) y

- dist/assets/editor-C5hKzirS.js (changed, uploading)
- dist/assets/index-Y4iKPMD9.js (changed, uploading)
- dist/assets/react-CgX-Mgf-.js (changed, uploading)
- dist/assets/turbo-DVJqhdOv.js (changed, uploading)
- dist/index-d05edd90.html (changed, uploading)
- manifest.json (changed, uploading)

https://arweave.developerdao.com/8jctPVVUkKnvGhzXJpQsqj-E0ZKSOr1XYZlcB4sstqw
```

The deployment script will write a `deployment-id` file with the latest TXID to help find your
latest deployment.

**Congrats!!!**

You deployed your first Arweave DApp to the Permaweb. You can now write permanently stored articles
inside your browser; no need to run a deploy script anymore!

### Testing Deployed Release

The script logs the URL to the deployment, so you can immediately test it by opening it in your
browser. If you want to see what it looks like, try
[my deployment](https://arweave.developerdao.com/8jctPVVUkKnvGhzXJpQsqj-E0ZKSOr1XYZlcB4sstqw).

## Creating a Human-Friendly Name for the DApp

While the website is already usable, it isn’t easy to remember. You can improve this by pointing the
ArNS name you registered in the previous lesson to your new blog.

Adding an ArNS name will change your URLs from looking like this:

```
https://some-sandbox-id-9999.arweave.developerdao.com/some-transaction-id-9999/
```

To looking like this:

```
https://totally-awesome-blog.arweave.developerdao.com/
```

### Creating an ArNS Update Script

To update your ArNS name, you need the process ID of the ANT contract that controls it. You can find
it in the ArNS management console. Save it to an `ant-process-id` file so your script can read it.

To update your ArNS name with the help of the AR.IO SDK, create a new file at
`scripts/update-arns.mjs` with the following content:

```javascript
import * as fs from "node:fs";
import * as ArIoSdk from "@ar.io/sdk/node";
import * as TurboSdk from "@ardrive/turbo-sdk";
const files = ["ant-process-id", "deployment-id", "key.json"];
const [processId, transactionId, jwkJson] = files.map((file) =>
  fs.readFileSync(file, { encoding: "utf-8" }),
);
const signer = new TurboSdk.ArweaveSigner(JSON.parse(jwkJson));
const ant = ArIoSdk.ANT.init({ processId, signer });
const name = await antProcess.getName();
const rootRecord = await ant.getRecord({ undername: "@" });
console.log(`Submitting update for ArNS name: ${name}`);
console.log(`From: ${rootRecord.transactionId}`);
console.log(`To  : ${transactionId}`);
await ant.setRecord({ undername: "@", transactionId, ttlSeconds: 900 });
console.log("Update submitted successfully. The changes might take a few minutes to propagate.");
```

Then, add it to the scripts section of your `package.json` file.

```json
"update-arns": "node scripts/update-arns.mjs",
```

Now, you can run the new script after each deployment:

```bash
npm run update-arns
```

It will submit the update to the ArNS contract, and after a few minutes, you can access your new
blog via your ArNS name.

## Summary

In this lesson, you build a fully-fledged DApp. You used Arweave Wallet Kit to connect a browser
wallet and upload articles to Arweave. You structured your transactions to make them easily
discoverable via GraphQL. You learned how to configure Vite to create URLs that work with Arweave
gateways and how to structure your code and split your bundle chunks to save money on storage.

## Conclusion

This was the last lesson of the Arweave 101 track. It reiterated everything you learned in the
previous lessons by building a complete DApp. It was a long lesson, but it was worth it. You
encountered issues that could crop up in practice and learned basic solutions.

**Congratulations!**

You are now an Arweave developer and can host your frontends on Arweave. And since DApps hosted on
Arweave are just regular SPAs, you can use them for all kinds of workloads.

Is Ethereum your jam? Just include Viem or Ethers.js, and build a DApp powered by EVM smart
contracts!

Solana is where it’s at? Go and use web3.js and connect your users to your Rust smart contracts!

Did you get hyped by AO, the new compute network on top of Arweave? Install ao-connect and get
going! In fact, he AR.IO SDK uses AO processes under the hood, so you already used it when you built
the ArNS update script.
